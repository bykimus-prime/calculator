# calculator

Final project for the Odin Project foundations course section. This is an on screen calculator made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which will naturally combine everything I've learned so far. This ended up using more CSS grid for the calculator layout, primarily the buttons. I also used arrays to store values and syntax, and created a main function with a few subfunctions to call. 

I left room to improve this project in the future, such as adding more operators or other buttons, as well as making a backspace button once I know how to do these things better.
